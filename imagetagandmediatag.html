    <!--task-2 explore significant goals of html5
       1.Intro of audio and video: Audio and Video tags are the two major addition to HTML5.
        It allows developers to embed a video or audio on their website. 
        HTML5 video can use CSS and CSS3 to style the video tag. 
        You can change the border, opacity, reflections, gradients, transitions, transformations, and even animations. 
        HTML5 makes adding video super-fast and without having to build a video player.
        This saves time for the developer and offers the client a superior and more affordable solution. 
       2.vector graphics
         This is a new addition to the revised version which has hugely impacted the use of Adobe Flash in websites.
          It can be used to draw graphics with various shapes and colors via scripting usually JS.
         Vector graphics are scalable, easy to create and edit. It also supports interactivity and animation.
         Having a smaller file size makes transferring and loading graphics much faster on the web. 
         That’s the reason why many people prefer to use vector graphics.
       3. HTML5 allows users to have a consistent web experience across multiple devices. 
       4.It is a system that allows the modification of the appearance of web pages, as well as making adjustments to their appearance.
       5.Textbox PlaceholdersPrior to HTML5, you had to use JavaScript to put a placeholder in a textbox.
        No more; the placeholder attribute sets a value to display in the textbox until the field receives the focus.
        Moreover, if the user deletes the value and navigates away, it will once again reappear. Here’s an example:   placeholder="Enter your name"
       6. improved support for embedding graphics, audio, and video content using the new <canvas>, <audio>, and <video> tags
          multi-threading via Web workers
          new extensions to the JavaScript API such as geolocation
          new drag-and-drop functionality
          local storage and caching features
          many new semantic tags and new form controls to complement the structural logic of modern web applications
          The rest of this article highlights the new HTML5 DOCTYPE, FIGURE, and INPUT field features.

        <p class="dotted">Development of the film began during the production of The Predator (2018), when producer John Davis was approached by Trachtenberg and Aison, with a concept that they had been developing since 2016. In late 2020, the film's title was revealed to be the codename for the fifth installment in the franchise. Filming took place around Calgary during summer 2021, with the entire film shot in English and some sequences shot in Comanche as well.
         <mark>The remaining sequences were dubbed into Comanche by the cast, reprising their roles.</mark><sup>[4]</sup>
